## Visualizations

### SingleWave
Represents a single waveform with dynamic RGB values.

### Overlapping Circles
This visualization represents the interplay of frequencies as overlapping circles. Each circle's size and overlap are determined by the amplitude and frequency spectrum of the audio.

### Radial Shapes
The "Radial Shapes" visualization creates a captivating display of shapes influenced by the amplitude and frequency spectrum of the audio. As the music or audio input changes, these shapes adapt, morphing into complex and mesmerizing designs that respond to the rhythm and tone of the audio track. An intriguing feature of this visualization is that its behavior and appearance are affected by the mouse's x position. By moving the mouse across the screen, users can dynamically interact and alter the display, making it a responsive and interactive visualization.

### Mirror

### Particles
Particles visual showcases circles  or squares that move downwards and magnify based on the audio input. The motion and size of these particles adjust dynamically with the music
